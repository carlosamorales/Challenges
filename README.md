# Challenge-Week01
## As a marketing agency,
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a webpage meets accessibility standards,
   - When I view the source code,
     - Then I find semantic HTML elements.
   - When I view the structure of the HTML elements,
     - Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
   - When I view the icon and image elements,
     - Then I find accessible alt attributes.
   - When I view the heading attributes,
     - Then they fall in sequential order.
   - When I view the title element,
     - Then I find a concise, descriptive title.
